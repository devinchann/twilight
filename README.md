# Twilight

Twilight is an indev fantasy-styled Minecraft shader pack designed for OpenGL 2.1 compatibility (basically supposed to run anywhere). This shader pack is primarily tested on Mac, so if there are any issues with the shader on Windows, please submit an issue report (with screenshots and description of what is broken).

Big thanks goes to Jodie, Builderb0y and jaekmichie97 on shaderLABS for explaining me stuff and answering on my questions.
